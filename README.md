# Vinyl Collection App
My project is an app that allows you to track the records in your music collection, add your review (1 - 5 Stars), share your thought on the album, and view other users collection.

The app was designed as a simple way to know what albums you have and be able to take brief notes on which are your favorites, why, and then be able to view other users collections.

A snapshot of the app can be found here (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FpZTrsnveBbpmHfBpycGJptQlh-jCfPe/view?usp=sharing)
